## Weather App
This is a simple weather application that continues my journey towards becoming competent with React.js. It prompts the user to enter a City and Country, then takes that data and calls an API which returns the current weather and 3+ hourly forecast for the city. It is still in development and I am progressively adding features as I continue to improve with the React. 

### Things learned:
* How to fetch data from an API in JSON format
* Why/When/How React lifecycle methods are beneficial
* Why/When/How JavaScript map function can be used with arrays
* Solidified my understanding of state/props and parent/child component relationships
